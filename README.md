# Clicky Game

## Memory Game leveraging React

This game shows the user a selection of images, and invites the user to earn points by clicking on each image [that has not already been clicked].  For each (new) image identified, the user earns a point - and the app will remember the highest score achieved, until the browser is refreshed.

The game is hosted on heroku, and can be accessed via https://dry-reaches-59291.herokuapp.com/

With each click, the sequence of the images is refreshed, to present an additional challenge.  The images clicked are remembered until the next game starts.
